# IITM-ML-Project
This project is part of the IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications program, focusing on the field of Machine Learning (ML). The project was conducted on the Kaggle platform and aimed at predicting the success of bank telemarketing campaigns.

The dataset used in this project pertains to direct marketing campaigns carried out by a banking institution. These campaigns were conducted via phone calls, where clients were contacted to determine their interest in subscribing to a bank term deposit. In many cases, multiple follow-up calls were required to assess whether the client would subscribe (denoted as 'yes') or not (denoted as 'no').

The objective of the project was to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to the product, based on various features.

This project combines practical machine learning techniques with real-world data to solve a relevant business problem, showcasing the application of data-driven decision-making in the banking domain.
